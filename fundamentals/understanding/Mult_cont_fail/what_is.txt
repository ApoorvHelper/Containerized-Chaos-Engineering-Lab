Hello. This small-sub-project is based on Chaos Engeneering between 2 containers.

Motive to add 2 Container in such a way that if one container gets failed or Shutdown
then other will get to know that and log that.

Basically it will be like master and worker type of project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

									Steps to Create

1. initialize 2 Containers 1 intended to be A-logger-node and B-worker-node. You can also take multiple
	workers node.
2. If any worker node gets failed then it will log the data to logger-node.
3. logger-node will let us know.Considering main machine as the Master-node
