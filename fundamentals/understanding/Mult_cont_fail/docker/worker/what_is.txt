This directory is used for creation of both the nodes Master and Working Nodes. From parallel.sh and dockerfile. 

With the help of this Directory you can make it both go live.

NOTE: Run this script only when any of the node is not running. Otherwise it will kill other.

This script is written solely for beginners and script kiddies.


#sudo docker container run -it --name working-node --hostname working-node --network mult-cont -v $PWD/../../share/:/share setup
